## About the Project

This project is an **Online Journal** application that offers a modern way to capture your thoughts and experiences. Beyond standard text entry, it leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to enhance the journal-keeping process, making it more convenient and efficient. Users can either type their entries manually or interact with an integrated chatbot that can process both text and **speech input** to intelligently format and create diary entries.

The core idea is to provide a seamless journaling experience, where the AI assists by correcting grammar, fixing spelling, and even generating concise titles from raw spoken or typed content. This makes journaling accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
